## 🚀 Project Overview

**CEDT** (Circular-Economy Digital Twin) is a retail innovation solution that creates digital replicas of physical shelves to monitor stock levels in real time. Combined with predictive refill intelligence, it prevents overstocking and understocking, supports sustainability, and reduces food/waste footprint — specifically designed with Walmart’s scale and goals in mind.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Walmart’s large-scale inventory system often struggles with:
- **Overstocking or understocking** of items
- **Lack of real-time inventory visibility**
- **Customer dissatisfaction** due to out-of-stock situations
- **Wastage** from unsold perishable goods

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We introduce a **Digital Twin powered by AI and IoT**, enhanced with **Predictive Refill Algorithms** and **Blockchain-backed refill ledgers**, that ensures:

- Real-time stock tracking through smart shelf sensors
- AI-driven prediction of stock depletion and refill cycles
- Decentralized and tamper-proof refill orders
- Quantum-inspired optimization of supply chains
